    "text": "Welcome to the course website for\nIntroduction to Data Science with R and Tidyverse\noffered for GRADE Brain and other GRADE Centers at Goethe University in January 2023. This website serves as the central repository for all course materials. Here, you will find all slides, lecture materials, and links to your online development environment.\n\n\nMost academic fields require proficiency in at least one data-centered analysis tool. For many, the R programming language has become the tool of choice. However, the first steps in coding can be intimidating and discouraging—especially if you have never worked with a programming language before. This course aims at providing a results-oriented, applied, and hands-on introduction to the most important parts of a Data Science project in R. We will not only introduce the libraries and frameworks necessary for your analysis, but also focus on teaching you the implementation and application of those tools with small examples that you can work on yourself.\nOur goal is to show you the scope of possibilities within R and leave you with the impression that you can confidently implement your own empirical projects in R. We will focus on the Tidyverse ecosystem, a consistent and intuitive framework for building your data analysis from start to finish. After the successful completion of this course, you know how to apply the basic Tidyverse tools for common Data Science tasks in R—primarily data wrangling, data visualization, and results communication.\n\n\n\nWe aim this course at beginners who are either entirely new to R as a programming language and/or want to learn about the Tidyverse ecosystem. The course covers four primary areas of the typical data science process and introduces the respective tidyverse tools:\n\nPlotting with ggplot2\nData wrangling with dplyr\nCommunicating your results with R Markdown\nRegressions with tidymodels\n\nWe will not cover statistical or theoretical concepts in this course, as the focus will lie on applied coding.\n\n\n\nWe will let you eat cake first. What does that mean? Many programming courses start with the absolute basics — variable types, syntax, loops, etc. Those are important but quite dull in the beginning. Instead of monotonously walking you through those, we follow a different teaching philosophy.\nEach topic will start with a very friendly and sometimes a bit complicated cake. And you will dive right into it by executing and adapting the code for that “data science cake.”\nFor example, we will show you an advanced visualization right at the beginning of the course and focus on what is possible eventually. While this might appear intimidating at first (“how should I ever be able to code that from scratch?”), we will walk you through the steps and introduce the methods to get there during the course.\nThe course will alternate between short introductions to a concept or method and small do-it-yourself coding exercises. In between the three sessions, you are encouraged to work on provided exercises that further deepen your understanding.\n\n\n\nThis course is a beginner-friendly course. You do not need prior coding experience. But you are also more than welcome to participate if you are an experienced R user but want to learn more about the Tidyverse.\nYou will need an RStudio Cloud account. RStudio Cloud is a very convenient Integrated Development Environment, where we provide you with all necessary code to follow the course and work with small application exercises on your own.\nBy avoiding to install RStudio locally during the course, we can start right away with the more critical course content. If you already have set up a local installation of RStudio, you are, of course, more than welcome to use that instead. In this case, download the source files linked in the respective application exercises. Note that you won’t need to set anything up if you use RStudio Cloud.\nSince we do not want to waste precious time on the technical setup, we will use the RStudio Cloud as a simple—and already set up—development environment. We will send out detailed instructions and an invitation link in advance.\n\n\n\nWe will meet on three Tuesday evenings from 6:00 - 8:00 p.m. Please access the course via this Zoom link or the meeting ID 933 0794 1729 and passcode 692604.\n\n\n\nPart\nDate\nTime\nVideo Recording\n\n\n\n\n1\n12.01.2023\n18:00 - 20:00\nLink will follow here\n\n\n2\n19.01.2023\n18:00 - 20:00\nLink will follow here\n\n\n3\n26.01.2023\n18:00 - 20:00\nLink will follow here\n\n\n\nWe want you to make your hands dirty — that means we want you to code! Just following along fancy slides won’t magically transfer the skill of coding to you. But you actively engaging with the course content in your development environment will more likely do just that.\nThat’s why we need you to prepare accordingly:\n\nTry to follow the course with two screens or two devices (one for Zoom and the slides, and one for your browser with RStudio Cloud)\nPlease create an RStudio Cloud account before the first class. We have sent you a link to access all exercises on RStudio Cloud. Since we want you to start coding very early on in the first class, please ensure that you can access those course materials on RStudio Cloud before our first meeting.\n\nIf you have any questions, please reach out to one of us through the e-mail addresses on the bottom of this page.\n\n\n\nThis workshop alternates between lecture-style presentations and application exercises. In those hands-on exercises, you will actively try out the discussed tools and techniques in Zoom breakout rooms. We aim to adhere to the following schedule. Depending on our progress, we may discuss some parts a bit earlier or later during the course.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart\nDate\nTitle\nType\nLecturer\n\n\n\n\n1\n12.01.\nWelcome\nLecture\nLara\n\n\n1\n12.01.\nFirst data visualization: UN Votes\nApplication Exercise\n\n\n\n1\n12.01.\nMeet the programming toolkit\nLecture\nKarlo\n\n\n1\n12.01.\nThe Bechdel Test + R Markdown\nApplication Exercise\n\n\n\n2\n12.01.\nData and visualization\nLecture\nLara\n\n\n2\n12.01.\nVisualizing data with ggplot2\nLecture\nLara\n\n\n2\n19.01.\nVisualizing categorical data\nLecture\nLara\n\n\n2\n19.01.\nStarWars + Dataviz\nApplication Exercise\n\n\n\n3\n19.01.\nTidy data\nLecture\nKarlo\n\n\n3\n19.01.\nGrammar of data wrangling\nLecture\nKarlo\n\n\n3\n19.01.\nWorking with a single data frame\nLecture\nLara\n\n\n3\n19.01.\nHotels + Data wrangling\nApplication Exercise\n\n\n\n3\n26.01.\nWorking with multiple data frames\nLecture\nKarlo\n\n\n4\n26.01.\nData types\nLecture\nKarlo\n\n\n4\n26.01.\nImporting data\nLecture\nLara\n\n\n4\n26.01.\nNobels + Sales + Data import\nApplication Exercise\n\n\n\n5\n26.01.\nFitting and interpreting models\nLecture\nLara\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe course is self-contained, and you will most likely get all the necessary information for the application exercises from the slides. If you want to read more about given topics, we provide links to chapters in open source Data Science/Tidyverse/R textbooks. You will find the links on the following pages right beside the link to each chapter’s slides.\n\nWe suggest two textbook references:\n\nR4DS: Wickham, H., Grolemund, G.
