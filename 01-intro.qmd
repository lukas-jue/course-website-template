# Including Code and References

This is a book created from markdown and executable code.

See @knuth84 for additional discussion of literate programming.

You can include and execute code chunks in various languages, such as `R` and `Python`.
Note: you need to have the respective language installed on your machine to run
the language-specific code chunks.

*R Code*

```{r}
1 + 1
```

*Python Code*


<!-- ```{python} -->
<!-- 1 + 1 -->
<!-- ``` -->
